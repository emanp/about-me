The `sm:hidden` class in Tailwind CSS means **"hidden on screens equal to or larger than the small breakpoint"**.

### Tailwind CSS Breakpoints:
- **`sm`**: Screens `640px` and larger.
- **`md`**: Screens `768px` and larger.
- **`lg`**: Screens `1024px` and larger.
- **`xl`**: Screens `1280px` and larger.
- **`2xl`**: Screens `1536px` and larger.

### Behavior of `sm:hidden`:
- **Hidden on `sm` screens and larger**: The element is hidden on devices with a width of 640px or more.
- **Visible only on screens smaller than `sm` (below 640px)**: The element remains visible on devices smaller than 640px.

### Practical Example:
```html
<div class="sm:hidden">This text is visible on small screens only.</div>
<div class="hidden sm:block">This text is visible on medium screens and larger.</div>
```

### To summarize:
- **`sm:hidden`** → Hidden on `640px` and larger (small screens and up).
- **`hidden sm:block`** → Hidden on smaller screens, visible on `640px` and larger.
